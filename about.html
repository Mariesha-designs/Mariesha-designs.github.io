        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Mariesha Marshall, an aspiring web designer from Orlando, Florida with a background in Digital Media, with a specialization in Web Design and Social Platforms. Currently, I’m an Online Course Accessibility Assistant. I aspire to create intuitive and accessible digital experiences, utilizing skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design tools like Figma and Canva. My design philosophy prioritizes accessibility and user experience, which I’ve applied in internships and personal projects, such as [Name a Passion Project]. Outside of coding and design, I enjoy painting and playing video games, which inspire my work and keep my creativity flowing.</p>
